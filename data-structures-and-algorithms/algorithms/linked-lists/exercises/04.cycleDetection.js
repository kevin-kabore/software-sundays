/**
 * Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins.
 * If there is no cycle, return null.
 * 
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list 
 * that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. 
 * Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's 
 * next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
