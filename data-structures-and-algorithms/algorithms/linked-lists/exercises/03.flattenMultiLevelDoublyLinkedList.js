/**
 * Given a doubly linked list, list nodes also have 
 * a child property that can point to a separate doubly 
 * linked list in addition to their next and previous properties.
 * These child lists can also have doubly linked lists of their own, and so on.
 * 
 * Return the list as a single flattened doubly linked list. You are 
 * given the head of the first level of the list.
