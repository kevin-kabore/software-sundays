/**
 * Given a string, find the length of the longest
 * substring without repeating characters.
 * 
 * Example: 
 * - Input: abccabb 
 * - Output: 3
 * - Explanation: "abc" and "cab" are the longest substrings
 *  with 3 unique characters each

/**
 * Approach
 * Before you start: understand the question, write key points
*/

/**
 * STEP 1: Verify the constraints 
 * Ask your interviewer questions to understand what are
 * the edge cases, inputs, variables, etc.
 */



/**
 * STEP 2: Test cases. Write out some test cases
 * Ask your interviewer if it's okay to write out some test cases
 * to capture the constraints of the answers to the questions asked in step 1.
 */
// Best case

// Edge cases

// Less obvious


/**
 * STEP 3: Brute Force. 
 * Figure out a solution without code.
 * Think about a working logical solution without the context of code
 * and say it out loud. No need to optimize, just a working solution.
 * Cover the test cases
 */

/**
 * STEP 4: Code the brute force
 */

/**
 * STEP 5: Errors. 
 * Double check for errors
 * syntax, edge cases, closing loops etc...
 */

/**
 * STEP 6: Test. 
 * Test the code against the test cases
 */


/**
 * STEP 7: Time and Space. 
 * Analyze space and time complexity.
 */

/**
 * STEP 8: Optimize: can we optimize our solution? 
 */

/**
 * STEP 9: Code the optimal solution
 */

/**
 * STEP 10: Repeat step 6 and step 7. 
 * - Test again 
 * - Time and space complexities
 */

/**
 * STEP 11: Ask your interviewer if this is sufficient
