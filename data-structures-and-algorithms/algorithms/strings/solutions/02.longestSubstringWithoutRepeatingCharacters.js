/**
 * Given a string, find the length of the longest
 * substring without repeating characters.
 * 
 * Example: 
 * - Input: abccabb 
 * - Output: 3
 * - Explanation: "abc" and "cab" are the longest substrings
 *  with 3 unique characters each
 * 
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
 */

/**
 * Approach
 * Before you start: understand the question, write key points
 * 
 * substring question, finding longest length
 * subproblem: pattern-matching unique substring
 * 
*/

/**
 * STEP 1: Verify the constraints 
 * Ask your interviewer questions to understand what are
 * the edge cases, inputs, variables, etc.
 * 
 * Very important and common for string questions
 * Q: Is the substring contiguous?
 * A: Yes look for a substring not a subsequence
 *  - Contiguous: characters are sequential with no breaks.
 *      neighboring, beside one another
 *  - Substring: characters do not have any breaks between them
 *      sequential and side by side, therefore contiguous
 *      ex: "abc" in abcbbd
 *  - Subsequence: Can have breaks between them. Not contiguous
 *      ex: abcd in abcbbd is a subsequence but not a substring
 * 
 * Q: Does case sensitivity matter?
 * A: No, assume all the characters in the string are lowercase
 * 
 */


/**
 * STEP 2: Test cases. Write out some test cases
 * Ask your interviewer if it's okay to write out some test cases
 * to capture the constraints of the answers to the questions asked in step 1.
 */
// Best case
// Input: 'abccabb'
// Output: 3, abc and cab 

// Edge cases
// Input: 'abcadebc'
// Output: 5, cadeb

// null case
// Input: ""
// Output: 0

// low hanging fruit
// Input: aaaaaaa
// Output: 1


// Less obvious ex overlap
// Input: 'abcabd'
// Output: 4, cabd, which overlaps the c from the first non-repeating substring
