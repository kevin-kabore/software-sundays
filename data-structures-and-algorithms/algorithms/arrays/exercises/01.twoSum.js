/**
 * Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two 
 * numbers that add up to a given targer.

*/

/**
 * Approach
 * Before you start: understand the question, write key points
 * 
 * STEP 1: Verify the constraints 
 * Ask your interviewer questions to understand what are 
 * the edge cases, inputs, variables, etc.
 * 
 * STEP 2: Test cases. Write out some test cases
 * Ask your interviewer if it's okay to write out some test cases
 * to capture the constraints of the answers to the questions asked in step 1.
 * 
 * STEP 3: Brute Force. Figure out a solution without code
 * Think about a working logical solution without the context of code
 * and say it out loud. No need to optimize, just a working solution. 
 * Cover the test cases
 * 
 * STEP 4: Code the brute force
 * 
 * STEP 5: Errors. Double check errors
 * syntax, edge cases, closing loops etc...
 * 
 * STEP 6: Test. Test the code against the test cases
 * - best case example
 * - null cases (empty, no result/1 item, low hanging fruit/easy case)
 * 
 * STEP 7: Time and Space. Analyze space and time complexity.
 * 
 * 
 * STEP 8: Optimize: can we optimize our solution? 
 * - BUD: Bottlenecks, Unecessary work, Duplicated work
 * - DS brainstorm
 * 
 * STEP 9: Code the optimal solution
 * 
 * 
 * STEP 10: Repeat step 6 and step 7. 
 * - 6. Test the cases again 
 * - 7. Analyze the space and time complexity.
 * 
 * 
 * STEP 11: Ask your interviewer if this is sufficient
